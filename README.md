Used responsive web design techniques to enable a web application front-end to dynamically optimize for different screen sizes. Used a third-party front-end CSS library to implement responsive design using pre-defined templates, components and other features.

*****Assignment Requirement*****

Requirements
For this assignment, assume you are a web designer at a digital agency that creates websites for their customers (i.e. clients).  Pick two of the four imaginary clients listed below that you prefer.  Pretend that it is your job to design a website layout for each of two clients that you have picked.

 

*Part A

For one client that you choose, design a single website page.  The page that you design can be any single page of an overall website (e.g. a home page, an about page, an inventory page, etc.).  In other words, you are not designing an entire website with multiple pages.  You only need to design one page.  For this client, do not use Bootstrap or any other external styles in the design of the page you design.  Your page must meet the following requirements:

A navigational menu with at least 4 options must be present.

When the browser window is less than 720px in width, responsive changes must occur:
Content that was previously presented horizontally should be optimized for mobile screens.  This should be done in two different ways:
Columns of website content that were previously presented horizontally should be presented vertically (stacked on top of one another).
A grid of content (presented using CSS grid) should reduce the number of columns used to present the grid items when the browser window is less than 720px compared to when it is above 720px.

The navigation menu should alter itself to be optimized for mobile (whether that is making the menu vertical, or a hamburger menu, etc.).

An image should resize itself.

Make at least 3 other sensible responsive changes (text resizing, larger buttons, etc.).
